# Simple-EXT2-Filesystem

## Project Overview

### General Description

This project was for my Operating Systems class at my University (Washington State University). This project implemented a simple version of a EXT2-Filesystem. This project implemented linux commands such as cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, creat, rmdir, link, unlink, symlink, open, close, read, write, cat, cp, head, and tail. 

## Installation

I used VirtualBox as my virtual machine to run linux (Ubuntu 20.04). 

 - GCC
 - ext2_fs.h: ```sudo apt-get install e2fslibs-dev```

A lot of the documentation for this project and how to set it up can be referred to the course website which is linked [here](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/)

## Rules

Only use this as reference please since this is a school project.
